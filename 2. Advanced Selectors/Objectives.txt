Objectives:

Create a style sheet and link it to the html files. (Without changing the html.)
Style the sheet using the properties we covered in lecture.
Consider using some elements we didn’t cover, or didn’t cover well. You can search for the options online, or you can watch the videos from Week Four for some pointers.

Background:

I assume that you have finished all of the Week Two lecture videos, and you may want to watch Week Three as you complete this assignment. This assignment builds on Assignment One, but we have a new set of “After” pictures. You can see the newly styled pages here:

Steps:

Download the image from http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/images/flywheel.jpg and put it into a folder named images.
Style the following:

The body should have padding and margin
The header should have a background color, background image (using a local image), and padding
The navigation links (and only the links in the navigation) should be styled with a new display, margin, border-radius, text-decoration, and padding
The link to the current page should be styled differently from the other links (using class = "active')
The sections should be next to each other, not one on top of the other.
The images should be part of the page now. In addition, they should have a border, be centered horizontally, and have vertical (top/bottom) space between them and the other images.
