Objectives:

Create a style sheet and link it to the html files. (Without changing the html.)

Background:

In this assignment I have created a three page website about a game called Ultimate, or Ultimate Frisbee. We are going to use this site for all three assignments in this course. You can view the “before” site by visiting http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-1/index.html and clicking on the Home, Teams, and History links. You can see the styled pages here: (Obviously I can't give you a link, otherwise you could see my style sheet!!)
